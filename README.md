# blayze

A fast and flexible Naive Bayes implementation for the JVM written in Kotlin.

 * Fully supports the online learning paradigm, in which data, and even new features, are added as they become available.
 * Reasonably fast and memory efficient. We've trained a document classifier with tens of thousands of classes on hundreds of thousands of documents, and ironed out most of the hot-spots.
 * Models and data structures are immutable such that they are concurrency friendly.
 * Efficient serialization and deserialization using protobuf.
 * Missing and unknown features at prediction time are properly handled.
 * Minimal dependencies.

                        "body", "Good day dear beneficiary. This is Secretary to president of Benin republic is writing this email ..." // multiple features of the same type have different names
                ),

                Map.of( //Gaussian features
                        "n_words", 482.
                )
        ),
        "spam" // the outcome, in this case spam.
)));

Map<String, Double> predictions = model.predict(new Inputs(/*...*/));// e.g. {"spam": 0.624, "ham": 0.376}
